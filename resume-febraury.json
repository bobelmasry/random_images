        "Made a Python program using Tkinter, PYPDF2, Pdf2Image and PIL to automate the process of splitting a pdf question paper with up to 40 questions into a JPEG of each question on it's own reducing time needed to split the questions by almost 95%",
        "Automated classifying the questions into chapters using an AI naive-bayes text classifier with sci-kit to  analyze the keywords that are specific to that chapter using training data and reaching an accuracy of  90%",
